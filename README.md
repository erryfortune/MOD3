Here is an overview of all the tools used to build the site:

* This project uses [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) as an app to facilitate communication between the front-end and back-end.
* The design for the front-end is mostly handled by [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).
* The app uses [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) as its programming language.
* For massive storage (database), the app uses the [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) package which allows the app to create a schema and save the data to [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database.
* The website use the Oanda api to retrieve price data of different currencies
* Finally, The [React](https://www.reactjs.org) library is also used in this project.
